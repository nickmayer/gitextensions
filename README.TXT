GitExtensions is a shell extension, a Visual Studio 2008 plugin and a standalone Git repository tool.

How to compile GitExtensions
============================

- Open the solution file (GitCommands.sln)
- Compile SimpleShlExt in release for 64bit windows
- Compile SimpleShlExt in release for 32bit windows
- Compile entire solution in release, mixed platforms
- After everything is compiled in release, you can compile in debug

You could also directly compile in debug, but then you need to exclude the setup projects.
